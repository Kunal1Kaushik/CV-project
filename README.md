# CNN Similarity and Warm-Starting Ability
Authors: Daniel Wright (5932033) & Kunal & Alex

In this blog post we present the results of our study into whether CNN's learn similar filters and if these learned weights can be used to warm start a model. This work is part of the course CS4245 Computer Vision by Deep Learning in 2023/2024 at TU Delft.
